## Reporting Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project, please open an issue and provide as much information as possible. This will help us to understand the problem and fix it.

## Suggesting Enhancements

If you have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to an existing feature, please open an issue and describe the feature you would like to see. We will discuss the idea and decide if it is a good fit for the project.

## Adding Tests

Tests are unified across the project's implementations in different languages. Please refer to the repository [mkpoli/ainconv-tests](https://github.com/mkpoli/ainconv-tests).

## Development

General steps to contribute to the project:

### Making Changes

When committing, please also add a line to the `CHANGELOG.md` under the `Unreleased` section, describing the changes you made. If `Unreleased` section does not exist, please create it. This will help the maintainers to write the release notes when the time comes.

Commit messages need to start with a capital letter and a verb in the present tense, describing the change. For example, `Add support for Katakana` or `Fix bug in Cyrillic to Latin conversion`.
